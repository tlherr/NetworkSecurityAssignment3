Using the provided Assignment 3.pkt Packet Tracer File create the VPN as described below.


It is very simple instructions. 
Create a VPN from both Router 1 and Router 2 that terminates on Router 3.   To be clearâ€¦â€¦.Router 3 will have two vpn connections on it and the other routers will have 1 each.
You may use any Pre Shared Keys you want to make up but they must be different for both VPNâ€™s.
I should be able to ping from the laptops in Router 1 and 2 networks to the laptop in Router 3 network.    Tunnels should show up if I check.
Take screen shots at a few times during your configurations.   Take screen shots of the pings working.  Screen shot should include your name and student number in a text box.
Use google if you get stuck.   I have provided a doc as a reference.

Hint.   Remember the issue we encountered in class with the NAT rules needing to be modified.
Please remember to do your own work.  (Working in a group is fine but each student must do and submit their own work)    I reserve the right to question your work for further explanation on how you set it up.   Best to make sure you can answer by having done the config yourself.   ðŸ˜Š
